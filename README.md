# YTDisableShorts

Sometimes the YouTube Shorts Shelf keeps popping up even when ive clicked the disable button, and still you have to disable it again and again every 30 days.

So just to be spared of the pain in the ass I created this short <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">TamperMonkey</a> script to disable the YouTube Shorts Shelf when loading the page.
